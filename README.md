# GoodBye GoGuardian (DNS Server)
   (GoGuardian only)
   A hosts list that when added to your DNS server, will completely remove the GoGuardian extension on your Chromebook until reboot (you will have to change DNS back too)
 ---
 ## Status
   ðŸŸ¢ âœ…: The host list is working and has been tested to remove goguardian. The hosts list is  working. The hosts lists removes GoGuardian (until reboot) from extensions installed on the  Chromebook making it completely unblocked. 

---
  
## To do:
ðŸŸ¡ Host public dns server. (For now you will have to host your own DNS server and add the list to it. Then you will have to change the dns servers on the chromebook to use your server. You can also use something like NextDNS)

ðŸŸ¡ Finish the list (still gathering new information and domains from logs)

## INFORMATION ABOUT SOME BUT NOT LIMITED TO THESE CONFIRMED DOMAINS AND WHAT THEY DO!!:




1. **beacon-fullpage-predictor.goguardian.com**: This domain is related to GoGuardian Beacon, a student safety solution designed to notify designated staff about online activity that indicates a risk of suicide, self-harm, or possible harm to others. (this basically is used by teachers to tell if youre using websites they dont want you to be on atm like games)

2. **x3-predictor.goguardian.com**: While specific information about this domain is not readily available, it's likely related to GoGuardian's predictive algorithms, given the term "predictor" in the domain name. (this probably means goguardian has some algorithims that are used to determine if it should block this website, for example if you search web proxy goguardian will block it and check if it should be blocked using algorithms. It checks if it should be blocked using its algorithim. Kind of like an extension ad blocker)

3. **panther.goguardian.com**: Specific information about this domain is not readily available, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite, which provides tools for filtering and monitoring online activity, classroom management, and student safety.

4. **ip.goguardian.com**: This domain could be related to GoGuardian DNS, a DNS internet filtering solution that protects devices at the network level.

5. **inquisition.goguardian.com**: The specific function of this domain is not clear from the available information, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite.

6. **countvoncount.goguardian.com**: The specific function of this domain is not clear from the available information, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite.

7. **quiddity.goguardian.com**: The specific function of this domain is not clear from the available information, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite.

8: **blocked.goguardian.com**: oh wait why is this on here? im pretty sure any student who has suffered the pain of goguardian knows what this is! BOOO! U STINK, FATTY WEBSITE!

9. **ext.goguardian.com**: This domain corresponds to the GoGuardian Extension. Here are the main purposes of this domain:
    - Filtering
    - Monitoring
    - Safety

  So when you bootup your chromebook and login to your school account, your chromebook will send a request to this domain. When succesful, the domain will put the GoGuardian Extension on your chromebook.

10. **extapi.goguardian.com**: This domain likely refers to the API (Application Programming Interface) used by GoGuardian. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other. In the context of GoGuardian, the API likely facilitates data exchange between the GoGuardian platform and the extensions installed on student devices (explained further in 9).

11. **ws-goguardian.pusher.com**: This domain is related to Pusher, a websocket client used by GoGuardian. It facilitates real-time communication between GoGuardian extensions and the central GoGuardian platform. Essentially, it allows the extensions to send and receive data efficiently

## Stable hosts:

Stable hosts are confirmed hosts that are known to be used by GoGuardian. Make a PR if you have new ones.

## FYI

I WILL BE UPDATING THE LIST AS FREQUENTLY AS I CAN.
If goguardian realizes these domains are blocked its probably gonna try other domains so i will probably add those if i see it in logs. (if that happens)

This works so far so PLEASE do not try to use scripts or other methods. Scripts are probably patched by now and won't work, you will be wasting your own time. Things like the IncognitoDNS do work till this very day, however this method forces you to use a special unblocked browser and unblocked web proxy while everything else is blocked. The only way you can access websites is through there which isnt as reliable whereas the point is to disable/bypass GoGuardian. This list only disables GoGuardian so everything else works as normal.

## Unstable (suspicous activity) hosts:

So far these domains are cdns only. However I have reason to believe that these may be used since I see these too often. The stable hosts does the job for me so this is probably useless atm. Make a PR if you know more about these domains and if anything should be removed or added.

## For Fun hosts:

So far the only thing this does is potentially disable SafeSearch. I haven't tested it and I am using most of my free time to focus on Stable and Unstable hosts. If you have new domains make a PR.

## Contributing
You can host your own dns server and set it as your dns at school on the Chromebook your using to log domains in the query log so I can add any new ones that popup from your query log (At the moment I do not see any new ones popping up for me) to the list if there is any. You could also use something like NextDNS. Needs to have a query log at the very least. I only want the domain names/ip addresses of the domains, nothing else. Once you have the domains or log make a PR and I will check if there is any new ones and add them.
