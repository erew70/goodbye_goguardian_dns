ðŸŸ¢ UPDATE: âœ… The hosts list is working. The hosts lists removes GoGuardian from extensions installed on the Chromebook making it completely unblocked. The reason shy this happens specifically is because this hosts list in particular blocks the domain used to go and get the extension so it can put it on the chtomebook, this all happens at boot. If you block the domain it cant put the extension on your computer at boot thus removing it entirely. Changing wifi networks wont undo this, you will have to reboot.
Make sure you are usjng the wifi network with the custom dns settings at all times until after you login and wait a minute or 2 to confirm the GoGuardian Extsnsion isnt on your computer anymore. You canthen turn off the dns or switch wifi networks. However the school wifi dns prpobably logs everything you do so its best to stick to that dns until you reboot.
If you get "err_connection_reset" even if you disabled goguardian this is likely to do with proxy settings specifically on the browser or the school wifi firewall. I do not know a workaround yet you are gonna have to figure it out yourself. (For me its an issue with a proxy setup by my school)
Maybe try blocking the ip of the proxy server with your own dns server at boot. Might work but i have never tested so proceed with caution.
Also, when you login your chromebook will probably force a connection to a managed/school wifi. the second you login. So when the banner image appears kr any sign you have sucessfully logged in before it shows your apps and everythinf, turn off wifi, wait till ita finished logging in, then turn on wifi and connect to the network with the nrewly modified dns settings as fast as you can.

I will try to host my own dns so you guys dont have to so it makes this method easier to use.

i am still building the hosts but i will start uploading the domains but beaware more domains will probably be added (thank you for reading this)



INFORMATION ABOUT SOME BUT NOT LIMITED TO THESE CONFIRMED DOMAINS AND WHAT THEY DO!!:




1. **beacon-fullpage-predictor.goguardian.com**: This domain is related to GoGuardian Beacon, a student safety solution designed to notify designated staff about online activity that indicates a risk of suicide, self-harm, or possible harm to others. (this basically is used by teachers to tell if youre using websites they dont want you to be on atm like games)

2. **x3-predictor.goguardian.com**: While specific information about this domain is not readily available, it's likely related to GoGuardian's predictive algorithms, given the term "predictor" in the domain name. (this shit probably means goguardian is smart and has got some algorithims it uses to tell if ur gonna visit some website or smth like music)

3. **panther.goguardian.com**: Specific information about this domain is not readily available, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite, which provides tools for filtering and monitoring online activity, classroom management, and student safety.

4. **ip.goguardian.com**: This domain could be related to GoGuardian DNS, a DNS internet filtering solution that protects devices at the network level.

5. **inquisition.goguardian.com**: The specific function of this domain is not clear from the available information, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite.

6. **countvoncount.goguardian.com**: The specific function of this domain is not clear from the available information, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite.

7. **quiddity.goguardian.com**: The specific function of this domain is not clear from the available information, but it's part of the GoGuardian suite.

8: **blocked.goguardian.com**: oh wait why is this on here? im pretty sure any student who has suffered the pain of goguardian knows what this is! BOOO! U STINK, FATTY WEBSITE!

9. **ext.goguardian.com**: This domain corresponds to the GoGuardian Extension. Here are the main purposes of this domain:
    - Filtering
    - Monitoring
    - Safety

  So when you bootup your chromebook and login to your school account, your chromebook will send a request to this domain. When succesful, the domain will put the GoGuardian Extension on your chromebook. Meaning that this domain is used specifically to host the extension for schools. e
  Every GoGuardian Extension uses this domain. However, each and every school/district is given a different and unique GoGuardiam Extension. What makes each one stand out and unique is that the Extension ID is different from school to school because the software is paid. Which is why most scripts you find online that uses an extension ID specifically to disable goguardian will most likely not work. Every school/district has their own uniaue GoGuardian Extension ID. My theory on the purpose of a unique ID is to check if it has been paid or pirated, may also be unique to link the extension and admin account to a specific district/school during setup. Pirated GoGuardian Extensions probably serve no use because they are likely linked to a specific district/schoool admin account where all the filtering happems and monitoring with that specific admin account. So in short you have little to no control over a pirated copy at all.

10. **extapi.goguardian.com**: This domain likely refers to the API (Application Programming Interface) used by GoGuardian. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other. In the context of GoGuardian, the API likely facilitates data exchange between the GoGuardian platform and the extensions installed on student devices (explained further in 9).

11. **ws-goguardian.pusher.com**: This domain is related to Pusher, a websocket client used by GoGuardian. It facilitates real-time communication between GoGuardian extensions and the central GoGuardian platform. Essentially, it allows the extensions to send and receive data efficiently

Stable hosts:

Stable hosts are confirmed hosts that are known to be culprits of blocking, showing your screen 24/7, sending info, and potentially fetching lists that were setup by IT Department (who knows tbh).
This basically just means that they are known domains to (potentially) be blocking things and doing other things you dont like about goguardian like showing your screen and spying on you. These domains are most likely used as analytics and other information sent to your teachers but could also possibly be used to fetch a list of domains or filter that blocks websites.

I WILL BE UPDATING THE LIST AS FREQUENTLY AS I CAN.
If goguardian realizes these domains are blocked its probably gonna try other domains so i will probably add those if i see it in logs, (if that happens) okay?

Unstable (suspicous activity) hosts:
I have been seeing these domains in the logs somewhat frequently often, too suspicously often.
So far the list contains cdn's which are probably being used to send info of ur history and everything on a file.
domains that may be indirectly aiding goguardian in blocking by serving content and such, these are unstable and not confirmed to be used by goguardian so use this at your own risk this will probably break other websites.
If you have the time to test these host files (stable and unstable) at school, please do and make a pr/issue so i can update the lists. And do things like confirm if the domains are used by goguardian.

JUST FOR FUN OKAY? CHILL!:

So far the list only (potentially) disables safesearch, this DOES NOT MEAN that this makes it so goguardian doesnt block things you search up on google, lets say you search up "web proxy", goguardian is obv gonna block that. this list is somewhat useless because this does nothing to affect goguardian.
This list might as well also be unstable. all this does atm is remove safesearch from google, (i think it does) nothing else. again if you are testing the lists thank u very much and pls make a pull request or issue that will help the lists and add more domains or help me decide if the domains on the unstable list are used by goguardian or not. The domains on the unstable list may be only used by some districts (who knows) to do things like uploading analytics to teachers and staff which is why i put drive.google.com on the unstable suspicous list.

how do i see these "logs"?
i use a dns, if u dont get it here is meaning:

D **omain**
N **ame**
S **ystem**

So let me tell you, if you want to contribute to this too and be just like me helping make these lists for the repository, just contribute. to do this simple proccess, this is what u need to do:

first off you will need to setup a dns resolver like Pi-Hole, AdGuardHome, or any other alternative thats like those two solutions. (You can also use pre-hosted free resolvers like NextDns)

once you setup this its straightforward, forward your dns (pihole/adguard) to the internet like i did, (port 53 udp) keep your dns server on at home (dont turn off computer or let it sleep!!), connect to it at the school with the chromebook, and bam! Just do whatever ur supposed to do during those hours minding your own buisness because once u get home you will be presented with all the logs from the chromebook seeing which domains are being resolved aka called "query log" that you can access on your dashbaord, once you got the logs you can make a pull request with the raw unedited logs or you can just put the domains you think are the culprits of aiding goguardian or are being used by goguardian. thank you very much for contributing if you do it.


Once you have setup your own DNS server or have setup a free dns server like nextdns next thing you want to do is add all of those domains to nextdns or whatever dns you are using.

on the school chromebooks sometimes they will ask for like a login like something@district.org ewhere you login and sign out and somebody else can use it.
on the chromebook they force it to use the network setup by IT department. if ypou have this then change the dns settings to your dns. If you cant chamge the dns of the network used by default on the chromebook use the guest wifi if they hsve that or use your own hotspot.
once you set your dns reboot to take effect since goguardian would already be connected. you will want to connect to the network you just changed the dns settings on and login like normal and it should start working. if the managed network is forced onto your chromebook, turn off the wifi as soon as ypu can when iy logs in then turn it back pn and immediately try connecting to thaqt other wifi that has the dns settings you just set earlier and now it should work.

an issue however is that some websites are most likely blocked at the router level (at some districts it depends you will have to check.) but this can easily be mitigated by using a VPN server from home at the network level so you don't have to set it up manually on the chromebook.
err_connection_reset is one of the errors probably happening because the router is blocking it not goguardian. use a vpn+hotspot bozo. 
that error also could be caused by cache and cookies so try clearing that.
